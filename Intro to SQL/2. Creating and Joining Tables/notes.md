RELATIONSHIPS

tables relate to one another through different properties, usually we will link based on PRIMARY KEYS - the unique id for each row
types of relationships:
    one to one
    one to many
    many to many

```
JOINS
```
we can retrieve data from multiple tables using the JOIN clauses
we will select data from each table, joining tables on columns they have in common
our tables need to have common columns which we can include in our join clause

4 types on JOIN in SQL
    1) INNER JOIN
    2) LEFT JOIN
    3) RIGHT JOIN
    4) FULL JOIN
each will return a different set of results, depending on what matches
